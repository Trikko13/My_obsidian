1. So, in my view, trying to predict what the macro future holds is unlikely to help investors achieve superior investment performance. Very few investors are known for having outperformed through macro forecasting.
2. I think we can most gainfully spend our time in three general areas: 1) trying to know more than others about what I call “the knowable”: the fundamentals of industries, companies and securities, 2) being disciplined as to the appropriate price to pay for a participation in those fundamentals, and 3) understanding the investment environment we’re in and deciding how to strategically position our portfolios for it
3. In my view, the greatest way to optimize the positioning of a portfolio at a given point in time is through deciding what balance it should strike between aggressiveness and defensiveness. And I believe the aggressiveness/defensiveness balance should be adjusted over time in response to changes in the state of the investment environment and where a number of elements stand in their cycles
4. The key word is “calibrate.” The amount you have invested, your allocation of capital among the various possibilities, and the riskiness of the things you own all should be calibrated along a continuum that runs from aggressive to defensive. . . . When we’re getting value cheap, we should be aggressive; when we’re getting value expensive, we should pull back.
5. I lean heavily toward the first definition: in my view, risk is primarily the likelihood of permanent capital loss. But there’s also such a thing as opportunity risk: the likelihood of missing out on potential gains. Put the two together and we see that risk is the possibility of things not going the way we want.
6. professor Elroy Dimson said, “Risk means more things can happen than will happen.
7. Betting on black or white at even odds wouldn’t very profitable other than if you got lucky, and luck isn’t something you can count on. Betting in the absence of a knowledge edge regarding the contents of the jar wouldn’t be dependably profitable.
