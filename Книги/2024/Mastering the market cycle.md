“Risk means more things can happen than will happen.”

1. So, in my view, trying to predict what the macro future holds is unlikely to help investors achieve superior investment performance. Very few investors are known for having outperformed through macro forecasting.
2. I think we can most gainfully spend our time in three general areas: 1) trying to know more than others about what I call “the knowable”: the fundamentals of industries, companies and securities, 2) being disciplined as to the appropriate price to pay for a participation in those fundamentals, and 3) understanding the investment environment we’re in and deciding how to strategically position our portfolios for it
3. In my view, the greatest way to optimize the positioning of a portfolio at a given point in time is through deciding what balance it should strike between aggressiveness and defensiveness. And I believe the aggressiveness/defensiveness balance should be adjusted over time in response to changes in the state of the investment environment and where a number of elements stand in their cycles
4. The key word is “calibrate.” The amount you have invested, your allocation of capital among the various possibilities, and the riskiness of the things you own all should be calibrated along a continuum that runs from aggressive to defensive. . . . When we’re getting value cheap, we should be aggressive; when we’re getting value expensive, we should pull back.
5. I lean heavily toward the first definition: in my view, risk is primarily the likelihood of permanent capital loss. But there’s also such a thing as opportunity risk: the likelihood of missing out on potential gains. Put the two together and we see that risk is the possibility of things not going the way we want.
6. professor Elroy Dimson said, “Risk means more things can happen than will happen.
7. Betting on black or white at even odds wouldn’t very profitable other than if you got lucky, and luck isn’t something you can count on. Betting in the absence of a knowledge edge regarding the contents of the jar wouldn’t be dependably profitable.
8. But all this being said, there doesn’t have to be certainty in order for the
game to be worth playing. A knowledge advantage regarding the
tendencies is enough to create success in the long run.



Question that superior investor ask himself:
1) Are we close to the beginning of an upswing, or in the late stages?
2) If a particular cycle has been rising for a while, has it gone so far that
we’re now in dangerous territory?
3) Does investors’ behavior suggest they’re being driven by greed or by
fear?
4) Do they seem appropriately risk-averse or foolishly risk-tolerant?
5) s the market overheated (and overpriced), or is it frigid (and thus cheap)
because of what’s been going on cyclically?
6) Taken together, does our current position in the cycle imply that we
should emphasize defensiveness or aggressiveness?


the best buys oppotunity when:
1) investor psychology is sober rather than buoyant,
2) investors are conscious of risk or—even better—overly concerned about risk, and market prices haven’t moved too high.

1) When our position in the various cycles is neutral, the outlook for returns is
“normal.”

2) When the cycles are positioned propitiously, the probability distribution
shifts to the right, such that the outlook for returns is now tilted in our favor.
Our favorable position in the cycles makes gains more likely and losses less
so.
3) But when the cycles are at dangerous extremes, the odds are against us,
meaning the likelihoods are less good. There’s less chance of gain and more
chance of loss.
[[cycles.png]]
![[Cache/cycles.png]]

## The odds change as our position in the cycles changes. If we don’t change ur investment stance as these things change, we’re being passive regarding cycles;in other words, we’re ignoring the chance to tilt the odds in our favor. we can increase our bets and place them on more aggressive investments when the odds are in our favor, and we can take money off the table and increase our defensiveness when the
odds are against us

## The nature of cycles 
1) The events in the life of a cycle shouldn’t be viewed merely as each being followed by the next, but—much more importantly—as each causing the next.
2) As I will describe at length later, cycles oscillate around a midpoint (or a secular trend). Similarly, pendulums hang over a midpoint (or norm) and swing back and forth from there. But if you take the hang-point of the pendulum, turn it on its side and drag it from left to right as it oscillates, what do you get? A cycle.
3) secular” as in “of or relating to a long term of indefinite duration” per Webster’s New Collegiate Dictionary)
4) The oscillation bedevils people who don’t understand it, are surprised by it or, even worse, partake in and contribute to it. But as I’ve said before, it often presents profit opportunities for those who understand, recognize and take advantage of cyclical phenomena.
5) ![[Cache/phases.png]]

Notes:
*Henry Kissinger was a member of TCW’s board when I worked there,*
*and a few times each year I was privileged to hear him hold forth on*
*world affairs. Someone would ask, “Henry, can you explain*
*yesterday’s events in Bosnia?” and he’d say, “Well, in 1722 . . .” The*
*point is that chain reaction-type events can only be understood in the*
*context of that which went before.*


6) People often ask me “what caused the cycle to begin?” or “are we close to
the end of the cycle?” I consider these improper questions, since cycles
neither begin nor end. Better questions might be: “what caused the current upleg
to begin?” or “how far have we gone since the beginning of the upcycle?”
or “are we close to the end of the down-leg?” You might even ask
whether we’re close to the end of a cycle, as long as you define it as running
from one peak to the next, or from trough to trough. But—in the absence of
such a definition—cycles do not have a defined beginning, and I believe they
will never end.
7) The extremes of the cycle, on the other hand, are thought of as aberrations or
excesses to be returned from, and generally they are. While the thing that’s
cycling tends to spend much of the time above or below it, eventual
**movement back** in the direction of the **mean** is usually the rule
8) But, thinking back to the cycle
stages listed above, it can also be seen that the cyclical pattern generally consists as much of movement from the reasonable midpoint toward a potentially imprudent extreme (phases b, e and h in the preceding graphic) as it does going from an extreme back toward the midpoint (a, d and g).
9) In particular, that means the swing back from a high or low
almost never halts at the midpoint . . . regardless of how “right” or
“appropriate” the midpoint may be. The continuation of the movement past
the midpoint and toward the opposite extreme is highly dependable. For
example, markets rarely go from “underpriced” to “fairly priced” and stop
there. Usually the fundamental improvement and rising optimism that cause
markets to recover from depressed levels remain in force, causing them to
continue right through “fairly priced” and on to “overpriced.” It doesn’t have
to happen, but usually it does.
10) **Cycles have more potential to wreak havoc the further they progress from the midpoint—i.e., the greater the aberrations or excesses. If the swing toward one extreme goes further, the swing back is likely to be more violent, and more damage is likely to be done, as actions encouraged by the cycle’s operation at an extreme prove unsuitable for life elsewhere in the cycle.**




### This is a good time for me to make one of the most important points about the
### nature of cycles. Most people think of cycles in terms of the phases listed
### above and recognize them as a series of events. And most people understand
### that these events regularly follow each other in a usual sequence: upswings
### are followed by downswings, and then eventually by new upswings.
### But to have a full understanding of cycles, that’s not enough. The events in
### the life of a cycle shouldn’t be viewed merely as each being followed by the
### next, but—much more importantly—as each causing the next. For example:


*a) As the phenomenon swings toward an extreme, this movement gives it*
*energy, which it stores. Eventually its increased weight makes it harder*
*for the swing to continue further from the midpoint, and it reaches a*
*maximum beyond which it can no longer proceed.*

*b) Eventually it stops moving in that direction. And once it does, gravity*
*then pulls it back in the direction of the central tendency or midpoint,*
*with the energy it has amassed powering the swing back.*

*c) And as the phenomenon in question moves from the extreme back*
*toward the midpoint, the swing imparts momentum to it that causes it to*
*overshoot the midpoint and keep moving toward the opposite extreme.*

## With that said its easier to examine the people psyche as a moving physics power for cycles switch. The energy they produce cause fluctuations and accumulate the swing power back and forth most of the time.

### Relation between cycles:
1)The interrelationships among the various cycles are nowhere near as neat as my descriptions will be


# Далее идет разбор с помощью ГПТ
1. **Двойное влияние на циклы**:
    
    - Эндогенные (внутренние) факторы, включая предшествующие циклы.
    - Экзогенные (внешние) события, часто связанные с другими циклами.
2. **Переплетение циклов**:
    
    - Внешние факторы часто сами являются частью более крупных циклических систем.
3. **Сложность анализа**:
    
    - Разобраться в этих взаимодействиях сложно, но это ключ к успешной навигации в инвестиционной среде.

### **Применение**

- Анализ взаимосвязей между циклами для предсказания изменений.
- Учет экзогенных факторов для управления рисками.
- Поиск точек входа/выхода на рынке, опираясь на цикличность.


# **Записи из воспоминаний стр 31**
1. **Неизбежность циклов**:
    
    - Циклы происходят постоянно, их нельзя избежать.
2. **Иллюзия "на этот раз всё иначе"**:
    
    - Долгосрочные или экстремальные тренды создают впечатление, что старые правила больше не работают.
    - Примеры таких изменений: геополитика, технологии, поведение.
3. **Возврат к норме**:
    
    - В итоге "старые правила" снова оказываются актуальными, и циклы продолжаются.
    - Экстраполяция трендов часто ведет к ошибкам, так как ни одно движение не бесконечно (деревья не растут до небес).

---

### **Применение**

- Остерегаться аргументов "в этот раз всё иначе" при анализе рынков.
- Учитывать неизбежность цикличности и не полагаться исключительно на текущие тренды.
- Строить долгосрочные стратегии, основанные на исторических закономерностях.


1. **Сила циклов и кратковременность финансовой памяти**:
    
    - Циклы усиливаются из-за неспособности инвесторов помнить прошлое.
    - Финансовая память участников рынка коротка, что затрудняет распознавание повторяющихся закономерностей.
2. **Повторяющиеся ошибки**:
    
    - Каждое новое поколение считает текущие обстоятельства уникальными и новаторскими, игнорируя исторический опыт.
    - Прошлые события часто воспринимаются как устаревшие и неприменимые.
3. **Цитата Джона К. Гэлбрейта**:
    
    - В финансах история редко учитывается, что ведет к повторению тех же ошибок.
    - Уверенность в "чудесах настоящего" затмевает трезвую оценку исторических закономерностей.

---

### **Применение**

- Регулярно анализировать прошлые рыночные циклы для выявления схожих обстоятельств.
- Остерегаться чрезмерной уверенности в уникальности текущих условий.
- Использовать историю как инструмент для предсказания поведения рынка, особенно в моменты эйфории или паники.
1. **Самокоррекция циклов**:
    
    - Циклы разворачиваются естественным образом, без необходимости внешнего вмешательства.
2. **Причина разворота**:
    
    - Тренды сами создают условия для своей противоположности.
    - **Успех порождает предпосылки для неудачи, а неудача — для успеха.**
3. **Взаимосвязь трендов**:
    
    - Циклическая природа изменений обусловлена внутренними противоречиями и ограничениями.

---

### **Применение**

- Ожидать разворота тренда, особенно на экстремальных фазах цикла.
- Оценивать факторы, которые могут сигнализировать о смене направления (например, чрезмерный оптимизм или пессимизм на рынке).
- Планировать инвестиции, понимая, что успех или кризис имеют временную природу.
1. **Искажение восприятия циклов**:
    
    - Люди воспринимают циклы асимметрично:
        - Негативные колебания называют "волатильностью".
        - Позитивные колебания воспринимаются как "прибыль".
2. **Паническое поведение**:
    
    - Падение рынков описывается как "панические продажи".
    - Резкий рост можно считать аналогичной "паникой покупок" (например, технологический бум 1999 года).
3. **Капитуляция инвесторов**:
    
    - Внизу цикла инвесторы сдаются и продают активы.
    - На вершине цикла капитуляция проявляется, когда осторожные инвесторы начинают покупать в страхе упустить рост.

---

### **Применение**

- Оценивать эмоциональные описания рыночных событий критически, чтобы избежать когнитивных искажений.
- Распознавать "паники покупок" и "продаж" как сигналы о крайних фазах цикла.
- Использовать моменты капитуляции (внизу и на вершине) для принятия контрцикличных решений.



Такие вот мысли ,очень важные кстати

“**The air goes out of the balloon much faster than it went in.**

1. **Ограниченная симметрия циклов**:
    
    - Симметрия подъемов и спадов касается направления, но не всегда масштаба, темпов или времени.
2. **Вариативность развития**:
    
    - Подъем может завершиться либо резким спадом, либо долгой фазой стабилизации перед коррекцией.
    - Бум может расти годами, а спад зачастую происходит гораздо быстрее.
3. **Быстрота спада**:
    
    - Как отмечает Шелдон Стоун, спад напоминает "воздух, быстро выходящий из шара".

---

### **Применение**

- Ожидать асимметричности во времени: рост может быть постепенным, а спад резким.
- Учитывать возможность длительных плато на вершине цикла.
- Прогнозировать кризисные периоды с осторожностью, понимая, что спад может наступить внезапно.

1. **Неважность деталей**:
    
    - Конкретные обстоятельства циклов могут быть несущественными или неактуальными.
2. **Повторяемость тем**:
    
    - Основные темы, такие как оптимизм, риск-аверсия и излишняя доступность капитала, регулярно повторяются.
3. **Ключ к управлению циклами**:
    
    - Понимание этих повторяющихся тем и способность их распознавать — важнейший навык для работы с циклами.

---

### **Применение**

- Сфокусироваться на выявлении универсальных сигналов циклов вместо мелких деталей.
- Разрабатывать стратегии, основанные на повторяющихся темах, а не на уникальных характеристиках отдельных кризисов.
- Использовать понимание тем для предсказания рыночных поворотов.


*Finally, I want to bring in the definition of insanity that Albert Einstein is credited with: “**doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.**” When people invest in things after they’ve been carried aloft because “everyone knows” they’re both flawless and underpriced—thinking they offer high returns without risk of loss—that’s insanity. Such beliefs have been defrocked in the aftermath of every bubble. But many people—either unaware that bubbles tend to be followed by crashes, or blinded to that risk by their eagerness to get rich quickly—buy into the next one nevertheless.*


1. **Главное в циклах — темы, а не детали**:
    
    - Детали прошлых кризисов могут быть нерелевантными, но основные темы повторяются.
    - Распознавание этих повторений — ключ к успешной работе с циклами.
2. **Инвесторская "безумие"**:
    
    - По определению Эйнштейна: повторять те же действия и ожидать другого результата.
    - Инвесторы часто игнорируют историю, вкладываясь в "идеальные" активы, считая их безрисковыми.
3. **Непонимание природы пузырей**:
    
    - Бум и пузырь обычно сменяются крахом, но жадность и невежество заставляют людей снова инвестировать в "очередной пузырь".

---

### **Применение**

- Ориентироваться на общие закономерности циклов, а не на уникальные детали прошлых кризисов.
- Быть скептичным к активам, которые обещают высокую доходность без риска.
- Избегать ловушки повторения ошибок, изучая историю пузырей и их последствий.

Securities and markets that have benefitted from fabulous appreciation are much more likely to succumb to a cyclical correction than they are to appreciate ad infinitum. **Try telling that to the eager investor who believes “it’s different this time.”**

# Chapter 3. The regularity of cycles
1. Циклы зависят от человеческого участия ,а не от механики и процессов науки
2. Человеческие эмоции и психологические склонности создают вариативность и делают циклы менее предсказуемыми.
3. Рынки будут подниматься и падать, но точный момент, скорость и амплитуда этих движений остаются непредсказуемыми.
4. - - Знание причин и признаков циклических изменений дает значительное преимущество, даже если оно не идеально.
### **Применение**

- Признавать неизбежность неопределенности при прогнозировании циклов.
- Изучать циклы, чтобы выделяться на фоне большинства инвесторов, игнорирующих их.
- Использовать частичное понимание циклов для принятия более осознанных инвестиционных решений.
# Chapter 4. The economic cycle

Long-Term Economic Trends

1. **Циклы вокруг тренда**:
    
    - Большинство циклов представляют собой колебания вокруг долгосрочной тенденции или центральной линии.
2. **Краткосрочная и долгосрочная значимость**:
    
    - В краткосрочной перспективе осцилляции оказывают значительное влияние на компании и рынки.
    - Однако долгосрочные изменения тренда имеют гораздо большее значение для общей картины.
3. **Эффект осцилляций**:
    
    - Колебания вокруг тренда компенсируются со временем, но в моменте вызывают эмоциональные подъемы или спад у участников рынка.

---

### **Применение**

- Ориентироваться на долгосрочные тренды, а не на краткосрочные колебания.
- Оценивать фундаментальные изменения тренда как основной фактор для стратегий.
- Избегать чрезмерной эмоциональной реакции на краткосрочные рыночные осцилляции.

### **Применение**

- Учитывать, что текущая позитивная фаза может быть временной частью большого цикла, и готовиться к возможным негативным изменениям.

**Fear and greed**

**But eventually something changes. Either a stumbling block**
**materializes, or a prominent company reports a problem, or an**
**exogenous factor intrudes**. Prices can also fall under their own weight
or based on a downturn in psychology with no obvious cause.

**Fear and greed**
And thus fear comes into the ascendancy. People don’t worry about
missing opportunities; they worry about losing money. Irrational
exuberance is replaced by excessive caution

Euphoric investors may be excited about current developments and those
that may arise in the future, and this may accentuate their fixation with—and
expectation of—profit. On the other hand, depressed investors are unlikely to
feel positive enough to be greedy. If you think about it, euphoria is
inconsistent with fear, and depression is inconsistent with greed.

Optimism has tounderlie greed; it makes no sense to think people can be greedy and driven forward to invest when their expectations are negative. Clearly, optimism and pessimism encourage other emotions and influence behavior.

**The next phenomenon I want to touch on is the tendency of investors to swing**
**between credulousness and skepticism, and to fluctuate between being**
**entranced by the possibility of profit in the future and insistent on tangible**
**value in the here and now.**
Люди всегда колеблются в выборе получить прибыль сейчас или потом. *Будущее благо - проигрывает.*

## **Метафора про недвижимость**

Простая метафора с недвижимостью помогает понять колебания настроений инвесторов.

Что стоит пустое здание? Оно имеет **(а)** стоимость замещения, но **(б)** не приносит дохода и **(в)** требует расходов (налоги, страховка, обслуживание, проценты по кредиту, альтернативные издержки).

Когда инвесторы пессимистичны, они видят только убытки и не могут представить, что здание когда-то будет сдано в аренду и станет прибыльным. Но в моменты оптимизма они уже представляют его полностью заселенным и генерирующим большой доход, что оправдывает высокую цену.

🔑 **Главная мысль**: Стоимость активов в глазах инвесторов зависит не только от их текущего состояния, но и от настроений рынка. Колебания между чрезмерным пессимизмом и оптимизмом – мощный цикл, который нельзя недооценивать.

# The superior investor is mature, rational, analytical, objective and unemotional

Инвестор проводит детальный анализ **фундаментальных факторов** и **рыночной среды**. Он рассчитывает **внутреннюю (истинную) стоимость** каждого актива.

Покупку он совершает, если:

1. Текущая цена **существенно ниже** расчетной внутренней стоимости.
2. Есть потенциал роста внутренней стоимости в будущем.

🔑 **Главная мысль**: Рациональный инвестор покупает активы только тогда, когда разница между текущей ценой и внутренней стоимостью (с учетом будущего роста) делает покупку обоснованной.

*Чтобы уметь делать все вышеперечисленное, превосходный инвестор устанавливает правильный баланс между страхом (что сокращенно означает неприятие риска, нелюбовь к потерям и уважение к неопределенности и случайности) и жадностью (она же*
*стремлением, агрессивностью и приобретательством). Все люди испытывают эмоции, но лучший инвестор держит эти противоречивые элементы в равновесии. Наличие этих двух компенсирующих друг друга сил приводит к ответственному, мудрому и ро*вному
поведению.


As a social psychologist, I have long been amused by
economists and their curiously delusional notion of the
“rational man.” Rational? Where do these folks live? Even 50
years ago, experimental studies were demonstrating that
people stay with clearly wrong decisions rather than change
them, throw good money after bad, justify failed predictions
rather than admit they were wrong, and resist, distort or
actively reject information that disputes their beliefs.

## Chapter 8 the cycle in attitude toward risk
1. - Позитив заставляет увеличить оптимизм. Растущий оптимизм увеличивает толерантность к риску. Толерантность приведите к низкой премии за риск . Низкая премия ведет к низкой доходности за риск . Низкая доходность рисковых активов заставляет цены расти . Высокие цены делают активы еще более рискованным.  
    
- Иначе говоря риск высок когда все думают что риск дешев  
    
- Неадекватность ведет цены вверх и последующие паническое радение чрезмерно удешевляет активы от страха. Создавая адекватную премию за риск у аккуратных инвесторов  
    
- Рынок предвзят к риску . Он дает большие награды за возраста лиц риск в огромном размере в момент когда люди не хотят его брать (на панике ) 
    
- Когда толерантность высока , цены на активы вмешают больше риска чем доходности и наоборот при предвзятости к риску.

В моменты великого скептицизма никто не говорить что "Эта страшилка может быть чрезмерно негативной чтобы оказаться правдой". Писсимизм питается самим собой. 

**Скептицизм и Пессимизм не синонимы. Скептицизм вызывает пессимист когда оптимизм чрезмерен. Но так же вызывает оптимизм, когда пессимим чрезмерен.**

Рациональный инвестор усердный, скептичный и соответствущим образом ориентированный относительно риск профиля в разный момент времени. Но так же изучающих возможности ассиметрии сделок.
Важно заметить что таких людей меньшинство 
## Надеюсь эти пометки дадут понять что такое толерантность к рису и предвзятость к риску. И эти события будут отработаны корректно.

The most important Thing
The limits of negativism

## Chapter 9 The credit cycle. 

1. Выдающийся инвестор не тот кто покупает не качественные активы. А тот кто заключает выгодные сделки с высоким потенциалом и ограниченным риском.

Сдержанный, осторожный кредитный
обычно вытекает, приводит или подразумевает такие вещи:
* Страх потери денег
* повышенная предвзятость к риску и скептицизм
* нежелание одалживать и инвестировать несмотря на выгоду
* повсеместная нехватка капитала (но на бычке тоже бывает,аккуратно!)
* сложность исполнения долга
* низкие цены на активы, высокие потенциальные выходы, низкий риск и  чрезмерная премия за риск

Все вышесказанное укажет на идеальные рыночные условия. Будет трудно для большинства покупать в негативном цикле рынка. Даже несмотря на привлекательность потенциальной доходности.
Действуй.

Признаки перегретого рынка:
* Страх упущенной выгоды от сделки
* Пониженная предвзятость к риску и ноль скептицизма
* слишком много денег преследует слишком ограниченное количество сделок
* желание купить акции в увеличенном объеме
* желание купить акции в уменьшенном качестве
* высокая ценная на активы, малая перспектива возврата инвеста и скудная премия за риск.

Chapter 11 . Real estate
Да, вы можете там жить,да ее больше не напечатают( землю) и да, она в какой то степени защитить вас от инфляции. НО!
Ни одно из этих утверждений не спасет вас при покупке жилья по высокой цене.

У цикла рынков много общего с другими циклами.
1) Позитивные события повышают оптимизм
2) Восстановления психология увеличивает активность и желание покупать что-либо, даже дорого. Люди принимают риск охотно
3) Цены от эффектов выше - растут, повышая активность и еще больший рост - завышая уровень риска в пространстве.

Несмотря на схожесть в циклах, у недвижимости есть уникальны ингредиент, которого нет у других циклов. 
В кредитном рынке позитив приносит к желанию кредитования резко задирая цены от спроса на активы и занижая качество активов. Все это ограничивается скорость выпуска расписок.

Но у  рынка недвижимости - значительная задержка с этим. Прежде чем новое здание построится и добавится доля перегретости - пройдет время (оценка эффективности, поиск места и тд). При этом условия рынка меняются чаще, чем весь цикл стройки.

Формула от ГМ по недвиге.
1) Плохие времена вызывают низкую активность строительства и сдерживают поток капитала
2) Через некоторое время времена становятся не такими уж плохими, а со временем даже хорошими.
3) Хорошие времена увеличивают спрос на помещения
4) В течении плохих времен постройка нескольких зданий теперь уже вызывает картинку спроса/предложения и цены на ограниченный товар растут
5) Это увеличивает экономику владения недвигой пробуждая девелоперские желания к стройке
6) Лучшие времена и улучшенная экономика делает поток капитала более оптимистичным.
7) Дешевое и легкое финансирования сподвигает на увеличение девелоперами обладать обьектами.
8) Высокий прогнозируемый доход ,оптимистичные девелоперы и охотные провайдера капитала пораждают старт тренда на недвигу
9) Первые проекты стакливаются с сильным спросом. Отдавая девелоперам те самые высокие прогнозируемые доходности
10) Такие времена плюс каждодневные позитивные заголовки побуждают планировать больше строек .
11) Уходят года на стройку домов начатых ранее, пока первые постройки удовлетворяют горячий спрос.
12) Период между началом планирования и эксплутаацией довольно долгий и может застать угасающий цикл экономики. Проекты начатые в хорошие времена и открытые в плохие, вероятно вызывают снижение  платы на аренду и давят цены вниз. Незаполненные площади надвисают над рынком
13) Плохие времена вызывают уровень низкий уровень строительства и способность капитала его осуществлять.


Джон Кеннет Гелбрейт
Не так много областей деятельности человека, в которых история имеет столь мало значение, как в мире финансов. Прошлый опыт отвергается как примитивное убежище тех, кто не обладает достаточной проницательностью, чтобы оценивать чудеса настоящего.

Вечный рост недвижки
- **Миф о недвижимости как лучшей инвестиции**:
    
    - Существует распространенное убеждение, что недвижимость стабильно и значительно растет в цене со временем.
        
- **Исторические данные опровергают миф**:
    
    - Исследование Эйкхольца по ценам на недвижимость на канале Херенграхт в Амстердаме (1628–1973) показало реальный рост всего **0.2% в год** после инфляции.
        
    - Шиллер уточняет: **цены удвоились, но за 350 лет** — очень низкая реальная доходность.
        
- **Современные ожидания основаны на недавних аномалиях**:
    
    - Сильный рост цен на недвижимость — это **новое и исключительное явление**, а не историческая норма.
        
    - Ожидания постоянного роста могут быть иллюзией, обусловленной временным циклическим подъемом.
        
- **Исторический урок**:
    
    - Даже в недвижимости действует **цикличность**: рост → падение → рост → падение.
        
    - Идея, что "в этот раз всё иначе", как правило, ошибочна — история повторяется.
### **Применение**

- Относиться к росту цен на недвижимость критически, особенно если он основан на краткосрочных трендах.
    
- Учитывать инфляцию и реальные доходности при оценке инвестиций в недвижимость.
    
- Помнить, что циклы присутствуют и на рынке жилья — как и на любых других рынках.

### **Ключевые идеи (конспект)**

1. **Недвижимость и цикличность**:
    
    - Рынок недвижимости ярко иллюстрирует, как циклы не только следуют друг за другом, но и **взаимно порождают** последующие фазы.
        
    - Циклы имеют склонность уходить в **крайности** — от эйфории к глубокой депрессии.
        
2. **Фраза "только третий владелец зарабатывает"**:
    
    - Часто не выигрывает ни застройщик, ни банк, а **инвестор, купивший актив на дне** — у банка, который забрал объект при банкротстве.
        
    - Это **утрированное, но меткое напоминание**, как работает цикл: **боль рождает возможности**.
        
3. **Ценность циклов в "плохие времена"**:
    
    - Именно в спаде проявляется практическая сила понимания цикличности: возможность купить дешево, когда другие распродают.,


## Chapter 12. Puttuing it all together
Коллективные заблуждения
- **Поведение инвесторов влияет на рынок**:
    
    - Рынок — не просто внешняя данность, а система, **зависящая от поведения его участников**.
        
    - Ожидания инвесторов могут сами изменить результат, который они ожидают получить.
        
- **Рефлексивность по Соросу**:
    
    - В системах с мыслящими участниками (как финансовые рынки), **искаженные представления** могут **влиять на саму реальность**.
        
    - Пример: если большинство считает актив недооцененным — они начнут скупать его, поднимая цену, и превращая ложное убеждение в "правду".
        
- **Ложные убеждения → неправильные действия → измененная реальность**
    
    - Это замкнутая система, где ожидания усиливают тренд до его логического предела — часто до **крайностей и пузырей**.
- Contrarianism—doing the opposite of what others do, or “leaning
against the wind”—is essential for investment success. But as the
credit crisis reached a peak last week, people succumbed to the wind
rather than resisting. I found very few who were optimistic; most were
pessimistic to some degree. Some became genuinely depressed—even
a few great investors I know. Increasingly negative tales of the
coming meltdown were exchanged via email. No one applied
skepticism, or said “that horror story’s unlikely to be true.” Pessimism
fed on itself. People’s only concern was bullet-proofing their
portfolios to get through the coming collapse, or raising enough cash
to meet redemptions. The one thing they weren’t doing last week was
making aggressive bids for securities. So prices fell and fell, several
points at a time—the old expression is “gapped down.”
**The key—as usual—was to become skeptical of what “everyone”**
**was saying and doing. One might have said, “Sure, the negative story**
**may turn out to be true, but certainly it’s priced into the market. So**
**there’s little to be gained from betting on it. On the other hand, if it**
**turns out not to be true, the appreciation from today’s depressed levels**
**will be enormous. I buy!**” The negative story may have looked
compelling, but it’s the positive story—which few believed—that
held, and still holds, the greater potential for profit.


*It was the excessiveness of the prevailing pessimism that led me to write*
*“The Limits to Negativism” at the credit market’s low ebb in October 2008.*
*In it I pointed out, as mentioned in the chapter on attitudes toward risk, that*
*the superior investor’s essential skepticism “calls for pessimism when*
*optimism is excessive. But it also calls for optimism when pessimism is*
*excessive.” That variety of skepticism was totally lacking in the market’s*
*darkest days, of course.*


**HM and Bruce  Karsh bear market Bids:** *Thinking strategically, we decided that if the financial world ended—which no one could rule out—it wouldn’t matter whether we’d bought or not. But if the world didn’t end and we hadn’t bought, we would have failed to do our job*

В течение пятнадцати недель с 15 сентября по конец
года компания Oaktree инвестировала более полумиллиарда
долларов в неделю. В некоторые дни нам казалось, что мы идем слишком быстро, а в некоторые - слишком медленно; вероятно, это означало, что мы все делали правильно.

### When should one begin to buy?

Ждать "когда пыль уляжется" по словам HM  означает упустить возможности. Тейк про не нужность покупок падающих ножей - не правдив. **Они в Оактри жестко отказывается от идеи ждать дна для начала покупок!.**

* Во первых нет способа узнать достижения дна. Он определится лишь после ,когда возможности уйдут
* Во вторых, купить то что хочется можно лишь тогда когда продавцы паникуют  пока те, кто "не покупает ножи" стоят в стороне
Они покупали акции после первого проплывающего трупа в реке. В серение сентября 2008 и продолжали еще год. Тогда как оправившиеся от удара инвесторы лишь начали думать о покупке, последние продавцы ушли и ситуация выправилась. Оставив выгодные предложения в прошлом.

Чеклист чтобы покупать: 
1. Когда цена ниже уровня внутренней стоимости (предположим что оценка по добыче майнерами БТС). ЧТо если цена упадет? Бери еще, ибо очевидно что более выгодные условия (работает лишь с качеством!)
2. Эмоциональная стойкость включена для упорствования.
3. Планомерный заход (они брали 15 недель подряд в 2008м, в крипте в 2022 q3-q4 тоже были такие возможности)

Опыт 2008 и 2009 года показал, что даже если бы вы не продавали убыточные акции, но примерно вышли бы в ноль когда все это успокоилось спустя год. Однако если бы человек продал и капитулировал - все бы кончилось летально. Поэтому уходить из рынка когда он начинает падать и не принимать участие в его восстановлении - настоящий грех в инвестициях. 
	Нормально просесть по портфелю в фазе медвежки, при условии что ты продержишься и дождешься награды при ростке. 
	
	Поэтому никогда не скидываем активы (защищаешь ХЛ ) и набираем по правлиу 1 раз в неделю.


- **Успех — не был гарантирован**:
    
    - Прибыль Oaktree в период кризиса 2008 года — это не результат некоей "неизбежности", а комбинация верной стратегии **и удачного развития событий**.
        
    - Альтернативный сценарий (отсутствие вмешательства ФРС и Минфина) мог привести к **полному краху, сравнимому с Великой депрессией**.
        
- **Опасные выводы из кризиса 2008**:
    
    - Ошибочно считать, что **любое падение быстро отрастает**, и кризис всегда быстро "сам себя чинит".
        
    - Такое мышление приводит к снижению осторожности, усилению риска и **возможности еще более разрушительного цикла в будущем**.
        
- **Сила правильного позиционирования**:
    
    - Успех Oaktree — результат понимания **психологии рынка** и **механики циклов**, а не точного прогнозирования.
        
    - Это лучший подход в условиях, где **будущее принципиально непредсказуемо**.


We cannot presume to begin investing on the day the economy and
market hit bottom. Our greatest hope is that the low point will occur
sometime during the period when we are actively investing a fund,
and that we will buy on the way to, during, and after that moment.


#### Как позиционировать портфолию с течением цикла.

Подход "двойные риски". 
Есть 2 ошибки. Потеря денег и потеря возможностей. Можно устранить лишь одну, но тогда они полностью перейдут на другую. ПОэтому держим две в голове. В зависимости от стадии рынка мы меняем баланс. При высоких ценах, устраняем ошибку потери денег, при низких - ошибку потери возможностей.
Как? Путешествуй во времени. Условно, представляя что ты в 2026 году, ты бы вероятно сказал, что тебе нужно было вести себя более агрессивно? или более консервативно? Или может сейчас есть то, что потом заставит вас сказать "Я в 2025 потерял возможно лучшую возможность в жизни!".
**Покупай больше БТС или Стейблов в агрессивном рынке, и больше активов и рисков - в унылом и депрессивном.**
*In late 2008/early 2009, an investor* *needed only two things to make a lot of money: money to invest and the nerve* *to invest it. If he had those two things, he made a lot of money in the years that followed.... Control, discipline, selectivity and patience; the more of those things he had, the less money he made.* 

At Oaktree, we invested a lot, but we emphasized the senior debt of high-quality companies, not the junior debt and weaker issuers in which, as it turned out, we would have made even more money.


## Chapter 15. Cycle Positioning.
There are three ingredients for success—aggressiveness, timing and
skill—and if you have enough aggressiveness at the right time, you
don’t need that much skill.

Investment success:
6 keys points. One pair flows to another 
1. Cycle positioning  - decide the risk posture of port depend on cycle
2. Asset alocation - decide which markets/ market niches overweight and underweight
3. Aggresiveness
4. Defensiveness
5. Skill - ability to make decisions correclty into repeatable intellectual process (alpha)
6. Luck.  Randomness have more effect when skill is not avail.

Chapter 15. Limits on coping
На мой взгляд, вполне разумно пытаться улучшить результаты долгосрочных инвестиций, изменяя позиции на основе понимания рыночного цикла. Но важно, чтобы вы также понимали ограничения, а также то, какие навыки требуются и насколько это сложно.


временной лаг между кризисами может быть большой. Мы должны защищать портфели от опасности. Закалка эмоций поможет прожить остаток времени до взрыва пузыря , чтобы потом уже действовать более уверенно.

But remember, a swinging pendulum may be at its midpoint “on
average,” but it actually spends very little time there. The same is true
of financial market performance. Here’s a fun question (and a good
illustration): for how many of the 47 years from 1970 through 2016
was the annual return on the S&P 500 within 2% of “normal”—that
is, between 8% and 12%?
I expected the answer to be “not that often,” but I was surprised to
learn that it had happened only three times! It also surprised me to
learn that the return had been more than 20 percentage points away
from “normal”—either up more than 30% or down more than 10%—
more than one-quarter of the time: 13 out of the last 47 years. So one
thing that can be said with total conviction about stock market
performance is that the average certainly isn’t the norm. Market
fluctuations of this magnitude aren’t nearly fully explained by the
changing fortunes of companies, industries or economies. They’re
largely attributable to the mood swings of investors.

ИЗ этого следует что средняя доходность точно не является нормальной, ибо экстремальные отклонения (плюс 30 % и минус 15% были порядка 25% от общего срока). И цена доходностей компаний из года года весьма не всегда иллюстрировала именно такие колебания, что нельзя сказать о настроении инвесторов. Тут немного непонятно в какое место вставить эффективность рынка по Фаму.
Сттоит заметить что они не случайным образом разбросаны по  50 летнему горизонту, они кластеризованы внутри 1-2 лет идентичного по направлению экстремум движениюя  Херб стейн говорил что такие колабния сохраняются в течении некоего времени. **Речи о V образных откупах - нет.** И я думаю нам стоит перестать цепляться за пост пандемийные флуктуации.

Моменты:
1. Позитив заставляет увеличить оптимизм. Растущий оптимизм увеличивает толерантность к риску. Толерантность приведите к низкой премии за риск . Низкая премия ведет к низкой доходности за риск . Низкая доходность рисковых активов заставляет цены расти . Высокие цены делают активы еще более рискованным.
2. Иначе говоря риск высок когда все думают что риск дешев
Неадекватность ведет цены вверх и последующие паническое радение чрезмерно удешевляет активы от страха. Создавая адекватную премию за риск у аккуратных инвесторов
3. Рынок предвзят к риску . Он дает большие награды за возраста лиц риск в огромном размере в момент когда люди не хотят его брать (на панике )
4. Когда толерантность высока , цены на активы вмешают больше риска чем доходности и наоборот при предвзятости к риску.
5. Компании часто владеют долгосрочными активами (недвижимость,авто и тд). Тем не менее сбор капитала на такие вещи идет через выпуск краткосрочных Долгов . Так как цена займа на коротких экспирация -ниже. Так происходит паттерн «короткий займ для инвестиций в долго срок». Лучше всего делать когда кредитные рынки открыты для легкого займа . Однако ошибка в ликвидном выборе долгосрочных активов приведет к коллапсу
